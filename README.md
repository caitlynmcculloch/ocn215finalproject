# 2020 Significant Sea Surface Height Along the West Coast
***Caitlyn Mcculloch***
Swells can generate significant sea surface heights that can directly impact erosion levels along a coastline, provide key indicators on weather storm patterns, and predict sea conditions for mariner safety. My research aims to investigate the relationship between seasonality factors and wave heights along the West Coast over the span of one year in 2020. My hypothesis is if there is increased storm activity and ocean wind speeds during certain seasons, then these patterns will correlate with higher swell frequencies and elevated sea surface heights impacting the West Coast. My results confirmed a strong correlation between wind speeds and wave heights, supporting my hypothesis. Data shows that larger waves occur on the Washington and Northern California coasts during winter months, coinciding with more frequent storms and higher surface winds. In contrast, wave heights decrease in spring and summer due to lower and less consistent wind speeds. While other factors influence wave heights, these findings highlight the significant role of seasonality.
